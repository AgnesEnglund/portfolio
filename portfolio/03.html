            <h1>Internship: Spotify</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Spotify I worked with the Car Thing Operations Team that was about to launch Spotify’s very first hardware product - a music device for your car. </p>
            <p>My main task was to design a ”My Order Page” for the website where users would be able to track their order. Moreover I had side tasks that included holding a workshop for the team where we evaluated the entire webpage from the users’ perspective.</p>
          
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>MY ORDER PAGE</h3>
            <p>Together with another intern the team I was asked to bring a suggestion on how Spotify could own the communication with the user – from placing the order to delivery of the product. </p>
            <p>To do this, we started off by doing some research including social and environmental analysis, and benchmarking. Then we proceeded to map out insights and using thematic analysis where we clustered our findings, followed by creating a roadmap containing a MVP and a complete version. With the roadmap in mind we formulated user stories based off the different features of the page. </p>
            <p>After facilitating several workshops and design reviews together with the team throughout the course of the project we finalized our design by creating high fidelity prototypes in Figma, that ended up being implemented on the website</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>DESIGN REVIEW</h3>
            <p>The team invited us to review the design of the Car Thing website before it launched, aiming to gain insight on existing problems with the website. This meant that we started off our internship two weeks early, making a thorough evaluation of each segment of the page regarding four main areas: copy, structure, layout & bugs. After identifying the website’s problem areas we gave suggestions on how they could improve it.</p>
            <p>This Design Synthesis session was met with positive feedback and contributed to a lot of insights on our behalf on what was technically possible for them to modify. All in all, it was a very rewarding experience and they ended up taking our recommendations into consideration before launching the website.</p>
